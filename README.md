# Hack Recursive Factorial Function with Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow due to improper input handling.  The initial `foo` function calculates the factorial recursively but lacks error handling for negative inputs. The improved `foo` function adds this handling. The `bar` function shows how to use the factorial function.  The `main` function demonstrates calling both versions and showing the difference in behavior. 

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Hack installed and configured.
2. Run the code using `hhvm bug.hack`
